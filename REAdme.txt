❑ Air quality monitoring is important for a healthy and
safe learning environment.
❑ This project uses an IoT system to measure PM2.5,
PM10, CO₂, temperature, and humidity in real time.
❑ An ESP32 microcontroller collects the data and sends
it to a dashboard for easy viewing.
❑ The system helps improve environmental awareness
and supports sustainability at the university. Problem statement
